a system for automatically identifying car number plates
using a combination of optical character recognition (OCR) and number plate
detection methods. The proposed technology first identifies the car itself and then
captures an image of the number plate for further processing. This is accomplished
through the use of picture segmentation, which allows for the isolation of the
portion of the image that contains the car number. An optical character recognition
technique is used to identify the characters on the car number plate. This method
employs matching techniques to compare the captured image of the number plate
against the data stored in the database, in order to determine whether the characters
on the plate match those on record. When the legitimacy is established, the
warning notice will appear and the automobile will be allowed to enter the
permitted area. Real-time video is captured to evaluate the system&#39;s functionality,
and Python is used to create and simulate the system using a Raspberry Pi. The
experiment demonstrates that the system developed can find and identify a car&#39;s
licence plate on genuine images.
This makes finding a vehicle&#39;s licence plate the most intriguing and
challenging research topic. Managing parking lots, and identifying moving
vehicles all benefit from number plate recognition. Upon successful recognition of
the characters on the number plate via the optical character recognition method, the
encoded information contained within the plate will be extracted and subjected to
further identification procedures. These procedures may involve ascertaining the
vehicle&#39;s location, identifying its registered owner or keeper,
